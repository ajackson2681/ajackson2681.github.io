            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Poynette, Wisconsin, a very small town of about 2,500 people located just North of Madison on Highway 51. I attended 
                    all 12 years of my primary education at the Poynette School District and graduated in 2015. The town is mostly known for the
                    MacKenzie Center. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated High School from the Poynette School district in 2015, and it's where I learned of my love for Computer Science. 
                    For the first 3 years of college, I attended Madison College (also known as MATC) for their transfer program, and completed
                    most of my general education requirements. I finished up my time at Madison College in the spring of 2018. From fall 2018 
                    until December 2020, I attended the University of Wisconsin -- Madison for Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics.
                </p>

                    I am currently a senior software engineer for Genus PLC Research & Development. I work in the Biosystems Engineering department,
                    which develops sexing instrumentation for bovine genetics. My primary expertise is in embedded systems development and
                    peripheral device integration. Through my time here, I have developed a strong foundation in C and C++, but am also quite
                    comfortable with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java. I work almost exclusively in the Linux Operating System, so I
                    also have extensive experience writing shell scripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My primary area of interest is in embedded systems; I love working on devices that interact with the physical world.
