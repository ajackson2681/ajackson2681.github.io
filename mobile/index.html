            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up in Poynette, Wisconsin, a very small town of about 2,500 people located just North of Madison on Highway 51. I attended 
                all 12 years of my primary education at the Poynette School District and graduated in 2015. The town is mostly known for the
                MacKenzie Center wildlife preserve. 
            </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I graduated High School from the Poynette School district in 2015, and it's where I learned of my love for Computer Science. 
                For the first 3 years of college, I attended Madison College (also known as MATC) for their transfer program, and completed
                most of my general education requirements. I finished up my time at Madison College in the spring of 2018. Starting in the 
                fall of 2018, I have been attending the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, with a currently estimated graduation time of 
                December 2020.
            </p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently interning for Genus IntelliGen Technologies, which produces Sexcel for ABS Global. I am developing skills
                working with TypeScript and Angular applications, as well as Node.js and C++ addons for Node. In addition to my formal work 
                experience, I have completed a few personal projects, which are detailed further on my 'Projects' page, and from them have 
                gained a reasonable amount of experience in the Java and JavaScript programming languages. From various necessities in 
                work and for personal projects, I have also gained some experience in Python, but I am by no means fluent in it. Through 
                my education I have gained some entry-level experience with C. Although not a formal programming language, I also have experience
                with BASH scripting, and have created many utilities that assist me in my day-to-day work.
            </p>
            <h3>Fields of Study I'm Interested In</h3>
            <p>
                I have an interest in Computer Graphics, Software Engineering, and Networking. I enjoy
                solving tough issues, and learning new concepts. My dream was always to be a game developer, but through
                college (and a few failed attempts at writing my own games), I have begun to develop a fondness for business 
                applications of programming, and working towards the betterment society.
            </p>
