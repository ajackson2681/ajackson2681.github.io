                <h3>Jackson Flooring Inventory Manager</h3>

                <p>
                    The Jackson Flooring Inventory Manager is a simple inventory management system that was programmed by me to 
                    assist a small Flooring retail company by the name of Jackson Flooring in managing their inventory. It's a 
                    specialized sytem that is specific to that retailer but can be easily modified for more general use. The idea
                    behind this project was that most other inventory systems are too expensive and had many features that the 
                    retailer would not utilize. The entire program is written in Java, using the JavaFX UI library.

                <h3>MTG Card Fetcher for Discord</h3>

                    This was a personal project that was mostly just for fun and to play around with the Discord API. My friends and
                    I have a personal Discord chat channel for our Magic: The Gathering group. The bot works by interfacing with the
                    Scryfall.com web API to retrieve card information for Magic: The Gathering, and return that information in the
                    form of an image in the chat, and a link that contains either the EDHREC (for the Commander game variant), or from
                    Gatherer (which is the official Wizards of the Coast website). It also has additional features that are relevant
                    only to our group, and thus will not be found on the GitHub repo. This bot is written in TypeScript and runs via
                    Node.js.
                    <br><br>
                    An old version of the bot was written in Java utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA">Java Discord API</a>.
                    One disadvantage to this method was that Java does not handle REST APIs as nicely as JavaScript/TypeScript does. So
                    due to my lack of experience with REST APIs, I relied on a <a href="https://github.com/ForOhForError/ScryfallAPIBinding">third-party one</a> 
                    for interfacing with Scryfall.com. I no longer am putting any work into the Java bot, and as such, any glaring bugs that
                    exist will likely never be addressed. For those interested, the bot can be found <a href="https://github.com/ajackson2681/Card-Fetcher">here</a>.
