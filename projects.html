                <h3>Dungeon Master Tools</h3>

                <p>
                    This is an application written in Java, with the JavaFX framework. It is a tool that is meant to help 
                    dungeon masters run a game of Dungeons & Dragons (or other D20-baesd game) more easily. It has a monster 
                    lookup that interfaces with an sqlite database (that you can create yourself from scratch, following the
                    provided schema, or utilize the provided one that only contains information from the SRD). It also has 
                    a dice roller, an encounter builder that you can build from scratch using the monster database or by 
                    manual input, and then you can save/load these encounters later, and a notes section. It also saves your 
                    data between uses, so that you don't have to re-enter information.

                <h3>MTG Card Fetcher for Discord</h3>
                <a href="images/cardfetcher.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    <img id="cardfetcher" src="images/cardfetcher.jpg" alt="card fetcher bot in action">
                </a>
                <p>
                    This was a personal project that was mostly just for fun and to play around with the Discord API. My friends and
                    I have a personal Discord chat channel for our Magic: The Gathering group. The bot works by interfacing with the
                    Scryfall.com web API to retrieve card information for Magic: The Gathering, and return that information in the
                    form of an image in the chat, and a link that contains either the EDHREC (for the Commander game variant), or from
                    Gatherer (which is the official Wizards of the Coast website). It also has additional features that are relevant
                    only to our group, and thus will not be found on the GitHub repo. This bot is written in TypeScript and runs via
                    Node.js.
                    <br><br>
                    An old version of the bot was written in Java utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA">Java Discord API</a>.
                    One disadvantage to this method was that Java does not handle REST APIs as nicely as JavaScript/TypeScript does. So
                    due to my lack of experience with REST APIs, I relied on a <a href="https://github.com/ForOhForError/ScryfallAPIBinding">third-party one</a> 
                    for interfacing with Scryfall.com. I no longer am putting any work into the Java bot, and as such, any glaring bugs that
                    exist will likely never be addressed. For those interested, the bot can be found <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ajackson2681/Card-Fetcher">here</a>.

                <h3>Electron Speedrun Timer</h3>
                <a href="images/timer-reset.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                <p>
                    This project was conceived when I was attempting to learn how to speedrun Minecraft while playing on Linux. Unfortunately,
                    there didn't seem to be any good speedrun timers on Linux. This is just a simple timer that can be started, paused, and
                    re-started. Furthermore, the style can be customized, including font, font color during each of the states, and background
                    for chroma-keying in recording software such as OBS. All the styling options are outlined on the BitBucket README page. 
                    Although Electron is a cross-playform UI framework, this application only has pre-built images and installers for the Linux 
                    operating system (as of writing this). This was due to some difficulties with getting electron-builder-windows working on 
                    Linux (and thus, BitBucket pipelines). The application runs just fine on Windows, but will need to be built from source.
                    This project also has an example of utilizing bitbucket pipelines to automate the build process and post the results to the
                    downloads page of the repository.

                <h3>Browser Snake</h3>
                <a href="images/snake.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    <img id="snake" src="images/snake.jpg" alt="snake game in browser">
                </a>
                <p>
                    For this one I just got bored one night and wanted to try and make a game in the browser. I had worked with HTML canvases a
                    little bit in school, but never did any personal projects using them. This is just a simple implementation of the game snake.
                    Since it's just a single script file, I'll have the source embedded on this page rather than linking to a repository.
